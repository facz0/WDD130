    <h2>Fabrizio Cossío</h2>
    <p>I am Fabrizio or Fabri, i am 22 years old and I'm from Lima Perú. The career i am following is computer programing. <br>
        I love sports in general but I prefer soccer. Soccer is my love. I love also going to the gym everyday. I love to eat hamburgers a lot and i love computers obviously. <br>
        I live with my family composed by my father, mother, two brothers, one in the mision field, and my dog. In fact i have a beautifull girlfriend. <br>
        I am currently working in a callcenter that buy properties. All is in english. I call random people from the US and try to buy their properties if they are interested in selling.
        I am taking this course because I wanna learn about web design and also because I wanna be a web developer. <br>
        I am a member of the church since i was born. I served a mission 2 years ago in Córdoba Argentina. 
         </p>

    <p>I hope we can work hard together to be successful in this course!</p>
