        Content
      </h2>

      <p>My site is a place where the people can be free to view all the cakes or desserts that my girlfriend 
        can make. If the people want to order some desserts for a meeting, party, family meeting, or any event, 
        they will come to my site because here is the place where they going to find that. Also, my site has an 
        easy way to contact personally with the pastry chef. In the same way if the people have a customize cake 
        for a birthday or a married, they can order in my site talking with the pastry chef. The goal is that the 
        people can easily ask for the thing they want and want to return every time that they want to order.
        I hope that the people can see all easy. I want that they can find and view the list of things without 
        restrictions. I want to have all that they don’t have doubts. If they want prices, I going to give them 
        prices. If they want to know if she has a restaurant, I will let them know.  Also in the future I want 
        to put a place where the people can ask something not necessarily talking personally with the pastry chef, 
        something like a blog. <br>

        Talking about the thinks that people can do in the web-site. The first thing that you can do is to know 
        about the life and experiences of the pastry chef. You can see her age, her knowledges, how she learns, 
        where she actually works and more. Another thing is that you can have contact with the pastry chef, asking 
        for your order. In this section you will see the list of desserts and different examples of cakes and 
        customized cakes for to be easier to choose to you.  You will have and idea about what you can order. 
        Also, you will see the price. Another thing is her social media. There is a section of pictures of her 
        and her cakes. 
        Navigate is so easy, you can read and enter in any part that you want without get lost. We will need just 
        your personal information like name and phone number for take the order and no more. <br>

        I think that people have to visit my site instead other sites because first, they will find delicious 
        things and very beautiful designs for them customized cakes. The experience of to eat these desserts is 
        unique. The strong attractive of my site is the experience of the people with the food. If the people want 
        eat or order more, they will enter more often to mi site. The site is pleasing to the eye, the colors and 
        design are nice.
        This project or idea came to my mind because I want that the people see the work of my girlfriend and my 
        work. She works in a great place; she is the boss but her dream is to be independent. And I am actually a 
        web developer student. I am learning how to make web-site and one of my goals and dreams since I study this 
        career is make a website for my girlfriend. I want people know our work and progress with the time. I am 
        going to update this page as I learn more also for the people for them commodity and them comfortable 
        navigation.
        I hope people enjoy this work and help us to grow. I want this page be the best for their necessity.
